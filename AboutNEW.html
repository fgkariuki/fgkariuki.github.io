      <img src="images/j-cole-2014-forest-hills-drive-cover-art.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="300" class="cards"/>
      <p>&nbsp;I have a deep admiration for J. Cole as an artist and have been a dedicated fan ever since I discovered his music. The first album I ever listened to by him was "2014 Forest Hills Drive," and it left a profound impact on me. From the storytelling to the production, every aspect of the album spoke to me on a personal level, and it remains one of your all-time favorite albums. My favortie song on the album is "Love Yourz". </p>

      <p>My love for Burna Boy's music runs deep, and his distinct A sound has been a constant source of inspiration and joy for me. As an African myself, I was especially proud to see Burna Boy's music break records around the world, bringing African music to the forefront of the global music scene. The first concert I attended for a solo artist was Burna Boy and til this day it is still one of my favorites.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

      <img src="images/beyonce.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" class="cards"/>
      <p>As a young girl growing up, my older sisters often played Beyonce's music around the house, and it soon became a part of my musical upbringing. I found myself drawn to her powerful vocals and captivating performances. As I grew older, I began to realize the significance of Beyonce's representation as a black girl in America. Seeing her success and confidence inspired me to believe in myself and pursue my own dreams. Beyonce became more than just a musician to me; she became a role model and symbol of empowerment. Her music and message continue to inspire and influence me to this day. </p>

      <p>Over time&nbsp; I've developed a deep appreciation for Rihanna's music and her entrepreneurial spirit. I grew up listening to her music through my sisters.&nbsp; Her ability to use her musical platform and turn it into a successful brand is truly inspiring. I admire her for creating popular products like her lingerie and makeup lines, which have become must-haves for many people around the world. </p>
