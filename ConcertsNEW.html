      <img src="Images/dream.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="200" class="cards"/>
      <p>This is a picture from my first ever concer. It was for the south korean boy band named BTS. I travelved all the way to New Jersey with my sister to attend their "Love Yourself, Speak Yourself" Tour.&nbsp; At this time, I was a hardcore fan of theis I had watched all their mvs and listened to all their albums and I had even bought their merch and albums. BTS music had great messages to them and one of my favorite albums was "Love Yourself&nbsp; Her"&nbsp; which was speaking about loving yourself more which at the time I resonated with.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

      <h3>Governors Ball Festival</h3>
      <img src="Images/nygov.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200" class="cards"/>
      <p>This is a picture of when I went to my very first festical "New York Governor Ball" with my sister. This was an eye changing experience because I saw so many artists that I enjoy listening too as well as one of my favorites Burna Boy. This was also a scary experience for me because there were so many people and we ended up having to get pulled out of the crowd because how tight and crowded it was. I still enjoyed the concert and I would still do it again!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

      <h3>Love, Damini Tour - Burna Boy&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
      <img src="Images/IMG-4038.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200" class="cards"/>
      <p>After seeing Burna Boy in New York for the Governor Ball festival I told myself I have to attend his concert because he is such an amazing performer. I travelved to Houston,Texas with my two best friends to attend his concert and this was by far the best concert I have been till this day. His stage presence and his live band was amazing!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

      <h3>Dreamville Festival</h3>
      <img src="Images/IMG-6493.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200" class="cards"/>
      <p>This is the Dreamville festival located here in Raleigh,NC. If you don't know already dreamville is J.Coles music label with different artists his supports. During this festival he brought all the artists he supports as well as big named artists to attract crowds. J Cole is one of my favorite rappers of all time and although, I do not listen to the other artists as much I came because I wanted to support his label. He was also raised in NC so I wanted to support someone who comes from my state!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
